# Web Data Extractor & Excel Exporter

This Python script extracts data from a web page using regular expressions and saves the extracted values into an Excel file using the `openpyxl` library.

## Features:
- Utilizes regular expressions to match patterns in web data.
- Supports extraction of data formatted as "ID: value1_value2_value3".
- Exports extracted data into an Excel file for easy analysis and sharing.

## Usage:
1. Replace the `web_data` variable in the script with the string containing the data to be extracted.
2. Ensure the `openpyxl` library is installed (`pip install openpyxl`).
3. Run the script to extract data and generate the Excel file.

## Example:
Suppose you have a web page with data in the format:
```
ID: value1_value2_value3
ID: value4_value5_value6
ID: value7_value8_value9
```
Running this script will extract the values and save them into an Excel file named `extracted_values.xlsx`.

## Note:
- Customize the script according to your specific data extraction requirements.
- Ensure the web data format matches the defined pattern for successful extraction.
